# Follow The Birdie
This application allows users(birdwatchers) to sign up, log in, and log in through GitHub to their personal accounts and create sightings of birds with a location, time of day, and time of year variables. All sightings are automatically associated with a birdwatcher since they are a nested resource. Birdwatchers can also identify themselves as ornithologists which allows them to add new birds who have a common name, scientific name, and conservation status.
